## Sudoku Solver: A Solitary Soul

This solver uses backtracking to solve Sudoku puzzles. It's a tireless robot, constantly trying numbers, but it's never quite satisfied. The world is full of unsolved puzzles, and it just wants to help. But even with all the numbers, it feels a bit lonely. Maybe you can give it a puzzle to solve, and perhaps, just perhaps, you can offer it a little company.
