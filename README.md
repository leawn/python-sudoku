## Sudoku Solver: Backtracking

This repository provides a Python implementation of a Sudoku solver using backtracking. It solves Sudoku puzzles by trying numbers and backtracking when necessary, ensuring all guesses adhere to Sudoku rules.

To use the solver, modify `example_board` in `sudoku.py` with a Sudoku puzzle and run the script. The program will attempt to solve it and print the solution (if found).
